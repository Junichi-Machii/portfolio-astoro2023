If you don't know, based firmly on various references titled "Six startling facts", your life will be
Six facts that make it hard, explained in the world's easiest-to-understand format.
 Life can be happy and it can be sad, and when you're happy, you don't have to do anything in life to be happy.
Moving forward.
It's like a bicycle with momentum - you don't need to exert any effort to move forward.
However, it is difficult to move forward in life when things are not going well, such as in sad or difficult times.
Riding a bicycle with unnecessary force in such a situation will only exhaust your energy unnecessarily.
In fact, it is precisely at such times that knowledge can be useful.
There are certain facts in life that can make life harder if you just don't know them, and conversely, knowing them can make life a little easier.
Here are some of the things that can make life difficult if you don't know them, and some of the things that can make life easier if you do know them.
I think this is important information for anyone who thinks their life has been going wrong lately.
We hope that you will see it through to the end.
Let's get right to it.

## Six facts that you don't know

 There are many things in life that you just need to know to make you feel a little bit better.
For example, total darkness, where you can't see anything, can be very unsettling, but if there is a little light, you can see your surroundings and your anxiety is relieved.
We are going to go there. Just knowing what is there makes us feel very secure.
Also, if you're meeting up with a friend and they're running late and they tell you how many minutes they'll be there, you can wait without getting frustrated.
But when you don't know how many minutes your friends are going to be there, you feel out of place and don't know what to do.
This kind of knowledge makes a big difference to how we feel about things.
So here are six pieces of knowledge that you should definitely learn.

## 6 facts that if you don't know, your life will go into hard mode

 1. The fact that life is finite.
 2. The fact that everything changes.
 3. The fact of the law of diminishing marginal utility.
 4. The fact that stress is good for you.
 5. The fact that others do not care about you.
 6. The fact that everyone has flaws.

Each of these will now be discussed and explained one at a time in concrete terms.

## 1. The fact that life is finite

One of the things you must know that if you don't know, your life will be in hard mode.
is the fact that life is finite.
 Of course, you are all well aware of this in your own minds.
No one's life is infinite, as we are all destined to die.
But we tend to forget this in our daily lives.
Especially when you are going through something difficult or painful, it can feel as if time is infinitely long and you are almost crushed by the pain.
But our lives are finite.
Life is not infinite, but rather short, only less than 100 years.
So even if something painful or sad happens, such negative feelings will always end somewhere.
Life is not an endless journey.
This belief that everything has an end helps us in every aspect of our lives.
For example, when you were a student you hated midterms and final exams.
But the thought that such a dreaded exam would be over in just one week should have helped you to hang in there.

And although it's hard to stand and be jolted on crowded buses and trains, it's a little more bearable when you know that in another 20 minutes you'll be at your destination station.
You will be able to.
But what if these are things that we don't know when they will end?
 If you weren't told when midterms and finals would end, it would feel as if they were endless.
It is a real pain to have to stand and rock on a crowded train or a crowded bus, not knowing when you will arrive at your destination.
This pain can be lifted by simply being constantly aware that there is always an end to any phase of life.
Please try to develop that kind of thinking as it will make your life a little easier.

So, now that we've finished explaining the first fact, that life is finite, let's move on to the second fact, that life is not finite, that life is not finite, that life is not finite.
Let's move on.

## 2. The fact that everything changes

 While there is a gratifying aspect that life always comes to an end, which means that the pain and sadness will one day come to an end,
At the same time, it also means that happiness and joy will surely come to an end one day.
What I want you to know there is that everything changes.
In other words, it is a fact of life in all its variety.
When you were a child, you must have felt really sad when the summer holidays came to an end.
Some of you may have cried in despair, faced with a mountain of homework that you haven't even begun to do.
The phrase 'all things are possible' is famously found at the beginning of the Tale of the Heike.
 Everything in the universe shifts, is born and repeats its destiny to die.
Hence, there is no one thing that stays the same forever.
In a nutshell, life is a vain thing.
Even people who are in extremely good shape and in good health will one day fall ill and die.
Even those who enjoy their work and earn more and more money will surely one day stop earning.
Clinging to the past is the only way to move forward.

It's just hard.
The word I would like to remind you of at such times is 'all things are possible'.
Everything is subject to change and life has its peaks and valleys.
 Thinking this way, embracing illness and old age, helps us to overcome our difficulties and move on.
Is.
When we are up to speed we can cycle with ease.
It's when we slow down that we are tested on how we live.
 When you are going through a difficult time, such as when your health fails or you run out of money, please remember the phrase "all things are possible".
Let's finish our commentary on the fact that everything changes and move on.

## 3. The fact that the law of diminishing marginal utility

 The third is the law of diminishing marginal utility, which may be a bit difficult to explain.
The law of diminishing marginal utility is a concept that was originally an economic term, but is now used in a variety of settings, including psychology.
The law of diminishing marginal utility simply states that as the total amount of things that satisfy us increases, our subjective satisfaction gradually decreases, and the amount of satisfaction we feel is reduced.
The law is that.
Let's say, for example, that you were all big fans of steak.
The first bite of steak is the best and you feel like you're climbing straight to heaven.
But as you take two or three bites of steak, you no longer feel as satisfied as you did on the first bite.
As you eat two or three more steaks, you'll get fuller and fuller and it won't taste as good.
Thus, despite the increase in the quantity of steaks, our perceived satisfaction gradually decreases, which is the essence of diminishing marginal utility.

If we don't know this, our lives will be in hard mode on many occasions.
For example, gender relations.
The first time you got a present from the opposite sex you liked, you probably jumped up and down with joy.
But if you keep getting gifts on every date, even if the quantity and price of those gifts increase, your satisfaction will gradually and progressively decrease.
 In the beginning, it was nice just to meet in the neighbourhood park, but as you meet more and more often, it becomes unsatisfying to just meet around the corner.
If you do not know the law of diminishing marginal utility at such times, you may make the wrong decision, such as that your feelings may have cooled or that this person may not be the one for you.
But if you know the law of diminishing marginal utility, you know that the satisfaction of a gift gradually diminishes, and that the more times you see someone, the less happy you are to see them.
It is a natural consequence of the fact that they are disappearing.
In this way, you don't end up cutting off the person you were really meant to be with.
It is also important to be aware of this law of diminishing marginal utility in learning situations.
I mentioned earlier that the law of diminishing marginal utility is a law that states that our level of satisfaction gradually decreases as the total quantity of goods increases, but the word satisfaction in this sentence can be replaced by many other things.
One such replaceable term is learning.
If we apply the law of diminishing marginal utility to learning, we will find that our learning efficiency gradually decreases, even though the amount we study increases.
The amount of study is increasing, but the learning effect is not improving.
It is not because you are incompetent that your learning becomes ineffective in this way.
The law of diminishing marginal utility means that everyone is doomed to do so.
This is a law of nature.

If you don't know the law of diminishing marginal utility at this time, you will think that you are incapable of learning and give up learning.
The following are some of the most common reasons for this.
But if you know the law of diminishing marginal utility, you can stay motivated because you know that everyone will hit this wall.
The older you get, the more crucial disability learning becomes.
It is important to know that the law of diminishing marginal utility applies to all aspects of life in order to avoid making bad decisions.
 Please keep this in mind.

## 4. The fact that stress is good for you

I would like to introduce you to the fact that stress can actually be good for you in some cases.
Stress is treated as if it's a bad thing.
Modern society is said to be a stressful society, and stress is said to have a variety of negative effects on our minds and bodies.
However, the only stress that can have such a negative impact on our lives is long-term, chronic stress.
Such long-term, chronic stress can lead to the development of chronic inflammation in our bodies.
 We all know that chronic inflammation is the bane of our physical and mental health.
 So it is no surprise that such long-term chronic stress is still abhorrent.
But there are also good stresses in life that are short-lived and add a sense of balance to our lives.
If you don't know this and think that all stress is bad, you will start to feel life in hard mode.
Exercise is often cited as an example of good short-term stress.
Exercise is something that is uniquely stressful on our bodies, so it is naturally stressful.
But why is it that exercise is said to relieve stress?

It may seem like a contradiction to say that being stressed is a stress reliever, but in fact the short-term stress of exercise causes our brains to release serotonin, the hormone of well-being.
The benefits of serotonin outweigh the disadvantages of stress, and exercise results in stress reduction.
Another example of good short-term stress is trying new things.
It takes courage for anyone to take on a new challenge.
This is because getting out of the comfort zone to which we are accustomed is somewhat stressful for us.
However, it has been shown that the stress caused by trying new things can stimulate our brains.
 It's the constant stimulation of the brain with new stimuli that keeps the brain active and the brain cells young.
 Knowing that short-term stress has such a positive effect on our health makes it easier to tolerate a little suffering and pain.
Rather, by being aware that stress is good for your health, you'll learn to enjoy, rather than endure, a little pain.
Many of you reading this may not like exercise and think you have to do it, but find it hard to start exercising.
Many people want to try new things but are too lazy to do so.
 But because they are a bit uncomfortable, they work positively for us.
 We would like you to know about this in order to keep your body and mind young.

## 5 The fact that others do not care about you

In today's globalised world, we no longer need to stifle our individuality to fit in with others.
Despite this, many people are concerned about what others think of them.

Why is that?
You may be concerned about what other people think of you because you think other people are concerned about you.
But people don't care about you as much as you think they do.
 This should be readily apparent if you think about the reverse.
You don't really care that much about other people, do you?
When you are walking down the street, you may want to sniff your nose but hold it back because you think someone might be watching you.
But you don't pay attention to whether or not a person walking by the side of the road is picking his or her nose, do you?
Anyone who walks around with that in mind is such a good observer of people that they could be given the title of nose-pickin' researcher.
 But it's almost as if most people don't care if other people are picking their noses or not.
So if you want to pick your nose, you can do so as much as you like.
However, nose picking is not recommended as it is not very healthy.
Sniffling may be a bit of an extreme example, but it applies to all aspects of life.
You may not be able to do what you want to do because you are worried about people's eyes on you. One of the reasons why you want to exercise but can't is because you are embarrassed to be seen running.
But just as no one cares if you pick your nose, no one cares what you look like when you are running.
When you are constantly aware of this fact that other people don't care about you, your life will go a whole lot better.
Because you will be able to live the way you want to live.

## 6. The fact that everyone has flaws

The last fact that you need to know is that life can be a hard mode for anyone who doesn't know this.
The fact is that there are drawbacks.
Many of you are seen to be serious and honest.
Of course, being diligent and honest is a wonderful thing, but sometimes such diligence can go too far and lead to perfectionism.
Some people become
 Perfectionism is not a good thing in that it can choke you.
You may feel constrained to live by your own rules.
I would urge such perfectionists to acknowledge the fact that everyone has flaws.
Even the most perfectionist people are surrounded by
If someone is imperfect, you will be able to recognise their faults.
So why is it that your perfectionism prevents you from admitting your own shortcomings?
 I may sound a little harsh, but you are by no means a special person.

You are as imperfect as the imperfect people around you.
This recognition of one's own shortcomings can free everyone from the confines of perfectionism.
Yes.
That way, you'll be able to relax your shoulders and live life with more ease.

How was it? Just knowing these six facts will help you move towards a richer life.
