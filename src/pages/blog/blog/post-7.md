Programming languages have undergone a remarkable evolution since their inception, shaping the way we build software and transforming the technological landscape. From the early days of Fortran and COBOL to the rise of modern languages like Python and JavaScript, this article takes a deep dive into the history, present, and future of programming languages, exploring the trends, challenges, and innovations that have defined their evolution.

## Introduction

- [Definition of programming languages](../post-8)
- [Importance of programming languages in technology development](../post-9)

## Past

- Early programming languages (e.g. [Fortran](../post-10), [COBOL](../post-11))
- Procedural languages (e.g. C, Pascal)
- Object-oriented programming languages (e.g. Java, C++)
- Scripting languages (e.g. Python, Ruby)
- Functional programming languages (e.g. Haskell, Lisp)

## Present
